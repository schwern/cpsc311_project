Clear overview of project topic	

Context of project topic
	- category of systems programming languages but implementing/ influenced by concepts of functional programming languages
	- informal study of mozilla research team: half of the bug: use after free, out of range access, or related to integer overflow
	 -> addressing memory safety issues by applying Rust
	- most heavily inspired by the C and ML families of languages
	- similarity to C: fine control over memory layout and predictable performance
	- difference to C: Rust programs memory safe by default, only allowing unsafe operations designated blocks
	- also providing safer environments for concurrency
	- weaknesses of Rust in comparison to established programming languages: no/little IDE support, small ecosystem, high learning curve
