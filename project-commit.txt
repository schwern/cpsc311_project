Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project:

1. We would like to learn and apply Rust, e.g. by building one of the core utils like cat or by comparing C code with Rust code and show how Rust handles certain things (especially regarding memory safety) differently.

2. Another idea is to apply the tool Klee to a project on Github in order to analyze the code.

3. Using the programming language Elm, we would like to create a web application e.g. a clicker game.
