Project type, explain its value (why is language important -> industrial or research impact/everyday programming practice)
Relate topic to its context (-> other (systems) programming languages)
Technical elements of project topic contributing to importance (--> stuff like ownership, enums, etc.)
High-level description of a project on this topic for 100% goal (-> how we plan to implement coreutil)

Own! description of a topic and its value
Base description on existing work


Questions:
 - which coreutil?
 - proposal?
 - let him know about Ambi
 - also show bad experiences/disadvantages of Rust?
 - application of Enums etc?
 - textbook is a valid reference?, Why Rust? also?
 - Abstract, ..., conclusion? necessary as layout
 
 
 Submission format
 Professional Writing (clear, concise, easy to skim)
 Proper citation
 Clear overview of project topic
 value/importance/impact of project topic
 context of project topic
	- typical errors in C/C++ code:
 technical aspects of project topic
 potential project
 
 sort : concurrency / implement different variants -> use traits
